# CSCI120 namespace

This namespace includes interface definitions that will be used throughout the course. Some
of those include general interfaces, and then there are Untyped Data Structures and Generic
Data Structures.

Untyped Data Structures use the C# object class. Generic Data Structures use the <...>
Generic structure to dynamically determine their type.
